## Email Validation Process

The plugin uses a multi-step validation process:

1. **Syntax Check**: Validates email format using WordPress standards
2. **Disposable Email Detection**: Checks against known disposable email providers
3. **Role-based Email Detection**: Identifies generic role-based emails (admin@, info@, etc.)
4. **Domain Validation**: Verifies domain exists and has MX records
5. **SMTP Validation** (Deep mode): Tests SMTP server connectivity
6. **Scoring**: Assigns score based on validation results (0-100)

## Integration with Newsletter Plugin

The plugin integrates with The Newsletter Plugin using official hooks:

- `newsletter_subscription`: Validates emails during subscription
- `newsletter_user_confirmed`: Validates on user confirmation
- `newsletter_user_unsubscribed`: Logs unsubscription events
- `newsletter_user_bounced`: Handles bounced emails
- `newsletter_user_complained`: Processes spam complaints

## Database Tables

The plugin creates two database tables:

- `wp_wikis_email_cleaner_logs`: Stores validation results
- `wp_wikis_email_cleaner_scan_summary`: Stores scan summaries

## Security Features

- **Nonce Verification**: All AJAX requests use WordPress nonces
- **Capability Checks**: Admin functions require `manage_options` capability
- **Data Sanitization**: All input data is properly sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses WordPress prepared statements
- **File Protection**: Upload directories protected with .htaccess

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing**: Large email lists processed in configurable batches
- **Caching**: Validation results cached to avoid duplicate checks
- **Background Processing**: Scheduled scans run via WordPress cron
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old logs and temporary files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plugin won't activate**
   - Ensure The Newsletter Plugin is installed and active
   - Check PHP version (7.4+ required)
   - Verify WordPress version (5.5+ required)

2. **Scans not running automatically**
   - Check if automatic cleaning is enabled in settings
   - Verify WordPress cron is working properly
   - Check server logs for any errors

3. **Deep validation not working**
   - Ensure server can make outbound connections on port 25
   - Check if hosting provider blocks SMTP connections
   - Try disabling deep validation and use basic validation only

4. **Revalidation not working**
   - Ensure revalidation is enabled in settings
   - Check if there are any pending revalidation tasks in the admin UI
   - Verify that the revalidation frequency is set correctly

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, add this to your wp-config.php:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

Check `/wp-content/debug.log` for plugin-related messages.
